See the .ipynb file for the implementation of the first two questions. They are under "Q1" and "Q2"


To just view the notebook without installing jupyter or all, just go to http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lujonathanh/COS451/blob/master/PS1/PS1.ipynb

This may be much easier for you to check, since all the output is already in the file!

To actually run the code yourself, you'll need to first have the following installed.


Requirements: (the EASIEST WAY TO BE ABLE TO RUN THESE IS BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS titled "Installing Jupyter using Anaconda" from http://jupyter.org/install.html)
* Python 2.7
* matplotlib
* numpy
* jupyter (for Python 2)


Then, download and unzip the compressed folder. Then run "jupyter notebook" in that directory "PS1", and click "PS1.ipynb"
